This directory will eventually replace the install-birch directory.

The existing shell scripts will be replaced by Python scripts used
by Getbirch. Getbirch will eventually call scripts from this directory
during an install.

This directory is not used by the production version of BIRCH, 
and can be safely deleted, at present.
