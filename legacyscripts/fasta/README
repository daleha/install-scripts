This directory is used for downloading and installing the fasta2 and 
fasta3 packages.


Note: On the Univ. of Manitoba system, make sure to build the solaris-amd64
binaries on mira. If you build on toliman, it has a different set
of libraries and that won't run on merak or mira. So presumably, the
libraries on mira are the "lowest common denominator".
